<h1>Welcome to my GitHub profile! ðŸ‘‹</h1>

I'm a recent data analysis graduate with a passion for leveraging data to drive business decisions. I specialize in RDBMS, Big Data, scripting languages, and web applications. My goal is to maximize ROI, optimize performance, and automate tasks to drive efficiency and momentum in any organization.

ðŸ”­ Currently, I'm working on various data analysis projects, exploring different datasets to gain insights and create meaningful visualizations. I'm also developing my skills in machine learning and AI to take my data analysis skills to the next level.

ðŸŒ± I'm constantly learning and staying up-to-date with the latest trends and technologies in data analysis. I enjoy reading random scientific things online, writing poetry, and cooking up a storm in the kitchen. I'm a dog lover, wine enthusiast, and always up for a new adventure!

ðŸ’¬ Let's connect and discuss all things data analysis, poetry, or just life in general! Feel free to reach out to me on LinkedIn or through my email.

Thank you for visiting my profile, and I look forward to collaborating with you soon!
